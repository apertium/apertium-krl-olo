# apertium-krl-olo

Karelian–Livvi (Karelian) machine translation dictionaries and grammars for
apertium. I use the words *Karelian* and *Livvi* throughout just for automatic
conversions sake and to maintain some English terminology while being readable.
You could refer to it as *vienan–livvinkarjalan käännöskone* if you want or so.
